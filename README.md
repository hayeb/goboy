# GoBoy
A Gameboy emulator in Go

The goal of this project is to learn about CPU architecture, emulators and to write some Go. The emulator works for simple cartridges, like Dr. Mario and Tetris. Cartridges with multiple banks do not work correctly yet.

* Working graphics

### To do
* Implement audio
* Implement multiple banked cartridges
* Implement saving/loading state
